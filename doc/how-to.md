## Using Dockter

This document will take you through using Dockter to make your work reproducible and easy to reuse.

#### Prerequisites

You should have some basic working knowledge of Docker. [This hands-on tutorial](https://ome.github.io/training-docker/) is a good way to start. You can also
check out the [Katakoda set of Docker courses](https://www.katacoda.com/courses/docker).

#### Motivation

We encourage you to have a look at the above courses but the idea behind Dockter is that you don't need to master Docker. Dockter does most of the things for you
in order to set up a reproducible research environment.

Dockter is a tool to make it easier for researchers to create reproducible research environments. It generates a Docker image for a research project based on the source code in it. That means that you donâ€™t need to learn a new file format (`Dockerfiles`) to create Docker images.

In addition, Dockter manages the image building process to better fit your everyday workflow (determines package system dependencies, manages builds) and generates JSON-LD meta-data describing the image (from which citations etc can be generated).

#### 1. Setup

Dockter is a command line tool (at least for now). You will need `Node.js` and `npm` to run it. It is possible for all main operating systems:

* [Windows]()
* [Linux]()
* [Mac OS]()

#### 2. Dockter for R

#### 3. Dockter for Python

#### 4. Dockter for other languages
