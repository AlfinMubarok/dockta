# This example illustrates the use of Stencila's `Dockter` package. The example is based on the tutorial
# [Geocoding in R by Claudia Engel](http://www.rpubs.com/cengel248/97543])

# Load the required packages

There is a number of packages needed to do the geocoding analysis from the tutorial. These packages are commonly used in the geocoding community but require installation before the first use and updates further on. They are also unlikely to be available on cloud services providing access to R (such as R Studio Cloud). This means that anyone who would like to go through this tutorial hands-on has to deal with installting and setting up the packages.

Dockter can help with that by running through this RMarkdown file and checking for packages that need to be loaded, and from there creating relevant meta-data files allowing for building and running Docker containers which would include all that the user needs to run the analysis.


```{r  echo = T, results = 'hide'}}
libs <- c("ggmap", "readr", "sp", "rgdal", "dplyr", "XML", "hexbin", "classInt", "RColorBrewer")
lapply(libs, require, character.only=T, quietly = T)
```


**Note:**
The package `rgdal` [requires two libraries to be installed within the system](https://gist.github.com/dncgst/111b74066eaea87c92cdc5211949cd1e). Dockter will check these dependencies and make sure that they will be included in the `.Dockerfile` which it will create. This means that the 

# Getting the data

Shapefile of Philadelphia Census Tracts: Philly3.zip (new attributes added)
Table with Lat/Long for Philadelphia Homicides: PhillyHomicides.csv


```{r}
#download.file("",temp)
```



```{r}
philly <- readOGR(dsn= "." ,layer ="Philly3")
```
```{r}
names(philly)
```

N_HOMIC: Number of homicides (since 2006)
HOMIC_R: homicide rate per 100,000 (Philadelphia Open Data)
PCT_COL: % 25 years and older with college or higher degree2 (ACS 2006-2010)
mdHHnc: estimated median household income (ACS 2006-2010)

```{r}
spplot(philly)
```

Not particularly useful for any interpretation.

You can see that by default spplot tries to map everything it can find in the attribute table. Sometimes, even this does not work, depending on the data types in the attribute table. It also uses one classification for all the maps. (The latter actually makes sense, as otherwise youâ€™d be likely to compare apples with oranges.)

In order to select specific attributes from the attribute table to map we can give spplot the explicit attribute name (or names). Try this:

```{r}
spplot(philly, "HOMIC_R")
spplot(philly, c("HOMIC_R", "PCT_COL"))
```

Let us stick with one map now and try to improve it a little. First we want to change the color palette. For this we use a library called  RColorBrewer3.

To make the color palettes from ColorBrewer available as R palettes we use the brewer.pal command:

```{r}
# to explore, display all sequential color schemes now available
display.brewer.all(type = "seq")

# now let's use one of them, called OrRd
pal <- brewer.pal(5, "OrRd")  # we select 5 colors from the palette
spplot(philly, "HOMIC_R", col.regions = pal, cuts = 4)
```
